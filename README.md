# LucasNativo's Dotfiles

On this page, I'll be sharing my dotfiles with you.
This setup come with a bunch of useful tools and configurations for the Arch Linux.

Here's the list of the tools I'm using: neovim, tmux, zsh, git, nodejs, typescript, stow, ripgrep, fd, wget and much more.

## Install
   > make

## Features

### Neovim
   > nvim-lspconfig
   > Plug plugin manager

### Zsh as default shell
   > zsh-autosuggestions
   > zsh-syntax-highlighting
   > zsh-vi-mode
   > rupa/z, tracks your most used directories
   > Powerlevel10k as zsh theme

### [Rewritten in Rust: Modern Alternatives of Command-Line Tools](https://zaiste.net/posts/shell-commands-rust/)

> - [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - A cat(1) clone with syntax highlighting and Git integration.
> - [exe](https://github.com/ogham/exa) - Exa is a modern replacement for the venerable file-listing command-line program ls that ships with Unix and Linux operating systems, giving it more features and better defaults.
> - [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files.
> - [bandwhich](https://github.com/imsnif/bandwhich) - This is a CLI utility for displaying current network utilization by process, connection and remote IP/hostname - ` man bandwhich `
> - [git-delta](https://dandavison.github.io/delta/introduction.html) - Code evolves, and we all spend time studying diffs. Delta aims to make this both efficient and enjoyable: it allows you to make extensive changes to the layout and styling of diffs, as well as allowing you to stay arbitrarily close to the default git/diff output.
